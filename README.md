Report Summary This report provides an exploratory analysis of Steam games popularity using data from the Steamspy platform. It begins with a detailed overview of the data cleaning and merging process for three primary datasets: steamspy_data_2024, steamspy_data_2019, and steam_reviewer_rating. We then utilized SQL to explore the dataset and define a "popularity" index for Steam games, based on key metrics such as number of owners, total reviews, concurrent users (CCU), and playtime, to assess each game's popularity level. This is followed by an in-depth analysis of the correlation between popularity and other features, including developers, publishers, genres, pricing, DLC quantity, and reviewer score. The analysis focuses on comparing similarities and differences between industry benchmarks and the performance of the top 1% most popular games. Additionally, we compare data from 2019 and 2024 to evaluate the overall progress of the gaming industry. The report concludes with a summary of findings, challenges encountered, recommendations for future research, and references.
